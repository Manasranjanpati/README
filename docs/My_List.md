# MyList

Mylist is a bucket where certain user can keep his `List` of itmes after prospecting them.

# 1. Create a list

- We are giving preassigned lists to all users i.e `default`, `linkedin`. To create a new list user have to upgrade his/her plans to paid version.
- User can create number of lists using his desire and assign contacts to it.
- Ex- `MyList-Facebook-Contacts`

# 2. Assigning a contact to list

- User can add contacts to a `list` by prospecting the contact in Database or RealTime search.
- Later the user can filter the contacts according to his/her lists by selecting a certain list.
- To assign a contact the user has to view contact in DB or RealTime then he can add the contacts by selecting a List he has.

# 3. Editing and delete the list
- We have a nice feature for users to edit the contact after assigning to a list in his MyList.
- Users can either edit the Contact or delete it.
- In the edit option we can edit all fields of the contact, assign new values like `adress`, `security number`, `personal email` etc.
